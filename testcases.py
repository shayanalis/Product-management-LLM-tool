     "Score: 3/4. The Job To Be Done (JTBD) 'onboard passengers' for the actor 'pilot' is functional and singular, as it represents a single task that the pilot might need to complete. It is also accurate as it does not include any unnecessary details or adjectives. However, it may not be entirely appropriate. While a pilot does play a role in the process of onboarding passengers, this task is typically handled by flight attendants or ground staff. The pilot's primary job is to fly the plane. Therefore, the JTBD could be more appropriately defined for the actor 'pilot'."
