# 🚀Use cases

Definition: Use Case: A specific circumstance or set of circumstances in which the actor (customer) does the Job To Be Done. Use cases are specific to each job to be done and each actor.

There are 4 Criteria for making Use Cases:
1. **Important.** It should be significant to the actor.
2. **Distinct.** There are clear, distinctive contextual differences between each use case.
3. **Clearly named.** It’s specific, unique and unambiguous. (You can put it on a web site.)
4. **Accurate.** The use case does not include the actor, JTBD, outcome, fertile land, .

Examples of valid use cases for the actor “Rider” and the job to be done “**Be driven to a destination**” are as follows:

1. “During extreme weather” 
2. “During peak hours”, “During normal hours”
3. “while riding with others”, “while riding alone”

A use case serves as a target circumstance for your product idea's application. Each use case can lead to different product features, products, pricing, designs, packaging, marketing messages, and more.

Here are some key points regarding use cases:

1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Use cases should be clear and specific. For example, "Shopping" is vague, but "Shopping online" is a more defined use case.
2. **Focus on Significance**: Concentrate on the most significant use cases to ensure broad relevance. Avoid overly narrow or niche use cases that have limited utility.
3. **Hierarchy**: Use cases can be organized in a hierarchy. Although sub-use cases are not commonly called such, they exist. For instance, under the main use case "Deodorizing," sub-use cases could include "Deodorizing refrigerators," "Deodorizing wastebaskets," and "Deodorizing recyclables." However, for this course, it's recommended to focus on top-level use cases.

To identify potential use cases, consider the following contextual prompts. Do not state the names of the prompts when writing use cases.

- **Locations**: Where does the customer perform the Job To Be Done (JTBD)? This could be at home, on mobile devices, indoors, outdoors, etc.
- **Environments**: In what environments does the customer engage in the JTBD? These could be hot climates, cold climates, remote meetings, on-site meetings, etc.
- **Timings**: When does the customer do the JTBD? This includes daytime, nighttime, remote meetings, in-person meetings, and specific occasions or instances.
- **Tools/Objects**: With what tools or objects does the customer perform the JTBD? This might involve iOS devices, Android devices, cloud services, specific voltage requirements (e.g., 220V, 110V), and more.

When creating use cases:

1. Exclude concepts like the JTBD or outcomes from the use case to keep it focused.
2. Keep use cases concise and to the point.
3. Aim for accuracy and precision.
4. Avoid introducing other concepts like outcomes within the use case.

You may need to combine multiple contextual factors to name a use case, as in the example: "Remote meetings on iOS devices."

Alternative Terms for use cases can be the following, however, they are not used in this course:

- “Use”
- “Usage Occasion” (often in the Consumer-Packaged Goods industry),
- “Operational Scenario” (MSE/Software Engineering)
- “Application” (often with Manufactured products)
- “Indication” (often in the Pharma industry)
- “Solution”

Criteria for Grading rubric for the Use cases:
1. (1 mark) Clearly named. The name is specific, unique and unambiguous.
2. (1 mark) Accurate. The name does not include a persona, benefit, outcome or JTBD
3. (1 mark) Current state. Represents a scenario that exists currently without your product.
4. (1 mark) Distinct. There are clear, distinctive differences between each use case
