# üöÄProblem

### The problem is defined as The gap between the actual outcomes the actors getting doing the job and the desired outcomes is the problem. It is also known as opportunity.

Your product needs to help customers get better outcomes.
For example, if your actor is getting a $100,000 salary, they deserve 150,000 salary.
Your product or service has to help them close that gap or eliminate that gap. 

The other thing is, it gets complicated because every actor has many oftentimes a number of desired outcomes and experiences.
And there are many actors
There's like the in the canvas software. We have, the Teaching assistant, a teacher, the student user, and the system administrator user, they all have different outcomes They want to achieve, it gets much more complicated.

So they have different outcomes and different jobs.
But you have to learn the basics that all these fundamental pieces first.
The way we go about uncovering these outcomes is through interviewing customers or users, potential users by observing them, doing their job, and sometimes taking our job and doing it.
So we understand the better. Sometimes we do surveys. Some people might still do focus groups.

And social media listening data analysis, you capture data when people do purchase on the Internet or whatever the thing is, there are all sorts of ways to get that information. However, we're not teaching any of those in this course because there‚Äôs just not enough time.

But the advantage of this is that you learn what you need to know so that you can actually go find that stuff that you need to know.

Okay. Alright. Now, alternative terms, use results, consequences, key results and results. Achievements.
Experiences, measures of we're using outcomes.

Sometimes customers (actors) do not know what is possible to achieve. Sometimes customers‚Äô desired outcomes are not realistic. You‚Äôll need to change their expectations of what is possible.

So I basically said, ‚ÄúIf I asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.‚Äù
And the message is that actors don't always know what's possible.
They don't know what's better. And so when you think of the term desired outcome and come, implies that the actors that's what you might think of as a desirable outcome.
That they would these being, they would desire it, one if they do as possible, and you can do it for okay.

So just keep out of mind sometimes you do young realistic outcomes, you know, like, you know, I don't want to get somewhere faster I want to get somewhere instantly.
We have the technology, they do that, and they might have an outcome.
That's not realistic. And then you have to reset their expectations or set a different goal. But the goal ultimately is to improve the results, and experiences are getting today.

That could be increasing, something decreasing, something maximizing, or minimizing.

So if the goal of someone is to increase our salary from 100,000 to 150, that's a goal.
That's also these are an hour. Okay? So that could be an interchangeable term there.
I probably should put that as one of the alternative terms.
