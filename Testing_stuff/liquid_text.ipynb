    "LLMs are a kind of deep neural network. They have been demonstrated to embed knowledge, abilities, and concepts, ranging from reasoning to planning, and even to theory of mind. These are called latent abilities and latent content, collectively referred to as latent space. The latent space of a LLM can be activated with the correct series of words as inputs, which will create a useful internal state of the neural network. This is not unlike how the right shorthand cues can prime a human mind to think in a certain way. Like human minds, LLMs are associative, meaning you only need to use the correct associations to \"prime\" another model to think in the same way.\n",

The idea is to capture as much, conceptually, as possible but with as few words as possible.
