- Product Management Essentials course by Jim Berardone at Carnegie Mellon University.
- Target audience: software engineers learning product management fundamentals.
- Concepts: specific, non-loose definitions compared to industry/internet usage.

Fertile Land:
- Definition: problem-rich areas for product/solution development.
- Purpose: identify familiar problem spaces for students.
- Scope: domain-agnostic, multiple problem spaces.
- Current state ("As Is") vs. future state ("To Be") transition through product implementation.
- Examples: public transportation, space exploration, online gaming, sporting events, farming, airline travel.

Problem Space:
- Components: Actor, Job To Be Done (JTBD), Use Case, Actual Outcomes, Desired Outcomes, Problem, Causes, Problem Size, Opportunity Size.

Actor:
- Definition: customer class interacting with future product.
- Importance: defines problem space, not specific problem.
- Examples: Rider in public transportation, Fan in sporting events, Ticketholder in music concerts, Cardholder in payment processing.
- Balance: not too general/specific, avoid geographic specificity.
- Alternative terms: Customer, Customer Persona, User Persona, Persona, Customer Archetype, User Archetype.

Job To Be Done (JTBD):
- Definition: fundamental task actor seeks to accomplish.
- Rules: Functional, Singular, Accurate, Appropriate.
- Analogy: product as employee hired for a job.
- Examples: "Plant crops" for Farmer, "Feed animals" for Animal rearer.

Use Cases:
- Definition: specific circumstances for actor's JTBD.
- Criteria: Important, Distinct, Clearly named, Accurate.
- Examples: "During extreme weather," "During peak hours," "while riding with others" for Rider's JTBD "Be driven to a destination."
- Contextual prompts: Locations, Environments, Timings, Tools/Objects.

Causes:
- Types: Root Causes, Contributing Causes.
- Techniques: Judgment, 5 Whys, Regression Analysis, Randomized Controlled Trials, Propensity Score Analysis, Causal Inference, Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram, Fault Tree Analysis, Failure Mode Effects Analysis, Pareto Analysis.

Outcomes:
- Definition: bridging gap between actual and desired outcomes through product use.
- Components: Metric, Quantified Measurement, Numerical Value.
- Metrics: Duration, Effort, Speed, Quantity, Errors, Risk, Decision quality, etc.
- Process: customer interviews, surveys, focus groups, social listening, data analysis.

Problem:
- Definition: gap between actual and desired outcomes.
- Complexity: multiple actors with different outcomes and jobs.
- Terms: Results, Consequences, Key Results, Achievements, Experiences.

Problem Communication:
- Problem Category: concise label for problem type.
- Problem Statement: clear, factual description including essential elements.
- Problem Narratives: in-depth stories with real examples and personas.

Problem Magnitude:
- Definition: size and extent of problem.
- Components: Amount, Severity, Frequency, Probability, Growth Rate.
- Annualizing: standardizing problem size comparison.
- Opportunity Size: number of individuals experiencing the problem.

Personas and Roles:
- Criteria: Specific name, Individual stakeholder, Accurate, Distinct.
- Essential roles: User, Decider, Buyer, Influencer, Gatekeeper, Initiator.
