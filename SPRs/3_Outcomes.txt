- Product development involves solving problems to bridge customer's current state to desired state.\n- Actor's success equates to achieving desired outcomes via product usage.\n- Each actor role harbors different desired outcomes.\n- Differentiation: goals are not outcomes.\n- Actual Outcomes: Numerically quantified results and experiences of completed jobs.\n- Desired Outcomes: Numerically quantified ideal results and experiences of finished jobs.\n- Outcome components: metric, measurement process, numerical result.\n- Outcome creation: improve actor experience, modify key components, quantify numerically.\n- Outcome quantification uses numerical values.  \n- Potential metrics include: duration, effort, speed, quantity, delay, error frequency, actual outcome variation, waste, risk level, decision quality, info quality, knowledge level, interaction number and quality, touchpoint quantity and quality, convenience, image, satisfaction, motivation, cognitive load, confidence, safety incidents.\n- Outputs not equivalent to outcomes.\n- Desired outcomes identification via interviews, surveys, focus groups, social listening, customer interaction
