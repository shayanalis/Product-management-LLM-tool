- Product Management Essentials course
- Taught by Jim Berardone, Carnegie Mellon University
- Target audience: software engineers
- Objectives: teach product management fundamentals

**Fertile Land**
- Concept: fertile land â€“ areas ripe for problem-solving, product opportunities
- Not domain-specific
- Includes multiple problem spaces
- "As Is" vs. "To Be" state transition
- Diverse range: transportation, exploration, gaming, events, farming, travel

**Problem Space**
- 9 aspects: Actor, Job To Be Done, Use Case, Actual Outcomes, Desired Outcomes, Problem, Causes, Problem Size, Opportunity Size
- Problem Space and Customer Actor have specific grading rubrics

**Actor**
- Represents user class
- Not organizations or physical entities
- Varies across fertile lands: Rider, Fan, Ticketholder, etc.
- Specificity balance; not geographically bound
- Alternative terms: Customer, User Persona, etc.

**Job To Be Done (JTBD)**
- Fundamental task customer aims to accomplish
- Functional, singular, and appropriate abstraction level
- Analogous to hiring a product for a job
- College-related examples: education, housing, commuting
- Grouping multiple JTBDs into higher-level ones allowed
- JTBD statement has a grading rubric

**Use Cases**
- Significant, clear, and distinct actor-specific circumstances for JTBD execution
- Named unambiguously, excluding actor, JTBD, outcome
- Hierarchy, clarity, and accuracy
- Contextual prompts: Locations, Environments, Timings, Tools/Objects
- Use cases grading rubric applied

**Causes**
- Differentiate between root and contributing causes
- Address root causes or mitigate contributing cause impact
- Problem-solving is cyclical, not linear
- Task, information, object analysis techniques
- Problem-solving techniques listed

**Outcomes**
- Actor success tied to achieving desired outcomes
- Quantified key components: metric, measurement, numerical value
- Metrics include duration, effort, speed, etc.
- Desired vs. actual outcome examples are numerical
- Outcomes statement has a grading rubric

**Problem**
- Problem: the difference between actual and desired outcomes; opportunity
- Complexities with multiple actors and outcomes
- Uncovering outcomes via interviews, observations, etc.
- Desired outcomes may require expectation management
- Problem communication involves problem category and statements

**Problem Magnitude**
- Problem magnitude: the scale and size of a problem; assessment factor
- Consists of amount, severity, frequency, probability, growth rate
- "Annualizing" for consistency
- Opportunity Size: number of individuals affected
- Data gathering and estimation techniques provided

**Problem Communication**
- Problem Category: concise type/class label
- Problem Statement: contains essential elements of the problem
- Problem Narratives: in-depth stories that make the problem tangible
- Problem Magnitude: used to evaluate, prioritize, and communicate the problem's significance

**Problem Complexity**
- Handling complex outcomes, gaps, and prioritizing problems
- Real-life applications: practical focus, iterative learning
- Magnitude and opportunity size estimation guidelines provided

**Grading Rubrics**
- Specific rubrics for evaluating problem spaces, actor identification, and various other course aspects
- Criteria provided for successful identification and grading of personas and roles
